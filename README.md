# Package Delivery Program
Based on predetermined destinations and packages to be delivered, a Python application was developed to deliver packages while minimizing the distance traveled by delivery trucks (using the nearest neighbor algorithm). The Python file reads data about destination distances and packages 
from corresponding csv files. A simple user interface in the Python program allows one to determine delivery times.
